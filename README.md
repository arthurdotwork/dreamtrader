### Purpose

The purpose of this app is to create a trading product from scratch relying mostly on open source technologies.

This implies several challenges such as:
- Rolling down our own account management system.
- Storing a large amount of data related to stock prices.
- Implement banking standards even though we will only use fictional money.
- Work on the clarity and simplicity of the product.
